Sat, 23 Nov 2019 10:29:10 -0500	Ex-CIA Officer Sentenced to 19 Years in Chinese Espionage Conspiracy	https://news.yahoo.com/ex-cia-officer-sentenced-19-152355446.html	"ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- A former CIA officer was sentenced Friday to 19 years inprison for conspiring to deliver classified information to China in a casethat touched on the mysterious unraveling of the agency's informant network inChina but did little to solve it.The former officer, Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 55,pleaded guilty in May to conspiring with Chinese intelligence agents startingin 2010, after he left the agency. Prosecutors detailed a long financial papertrail that they said showed that Lee received more than $840,000 for hiswork.Lee, an Army veteran, worked for the CIA from 1994 to 2007, including inChina. After he resigned, he formed a tobacco company in Hong Kong with anassociate who had ties to the Chinese intelligence community. Lee then beganmeeting with agents from China's Ministry of State Security, who assigned himtasks he admitted to taking on and offered to ""take care of him forlife.""While working in Hong Kong in 2010, Lee reapplied for employment withthe CIA but misled U.S. officials repeatedly in interviews about his dealingswith Chinese intelligence officers and the source of his income.Around thetime Lee began speaking to Chinese agents, the CIA was rocked by majorsetbacks in China as its once-robust espionage network there began to fallapart. Between 2010 and 2012, dozens of CIA informants in China disappeared,either jailed or killed, embroiling the agency in an internal debate about howChinese intelligence officers had identified the informants. Many within theagency came to believe that a mole had exposed U.S. informants, and Lee becamea main suspect.But FBI agents who investigated whether he was the culpritpassed on an opportunity to arrest him in the United States in 2013, allowinghim to travel back to Hong Kong even after finding classified information inhis luggage. FBI agents had also covertly entered a hotel room Lee occupied in2012, finding handwritten notes detailing the names and numbers of at leasteight CIA sources that he had handled in his capacity as a case officer.Theinvestigators apparently decided that by continuing to quietly monitor Lee,they might glean more clues about the disappearing CIA informants in China.But even after his arrest in 2018 on the same charge the CIA was prepared tobring in 2013, they were unable to determine whether Lee was involved in thedisclosures to Chinese intelligence operatives.Because of Lee's pleaagreement, in which he admitted to one count of possessing informationclassified as secret -- a lower level than top secret -- prosecutors asked fora relatively lighter sentence of roughly 22 to 27 years, rather than life inprison.But prosecutors argued that even if Lee never turned over informationto Chinese intelligence officers, the fact that he shared his knowledge ofU.S. intelligence work with Chinese agents alone could have a chilling effecton the CIA's source-building efforts.""It makes it difficult to recruit peoplein the future if they know the CIA isn't protecting their people,"" said AdamL. Small, a federal prosecutor in Northern Virginia, where Lee was charged.""These are people who put their names and lives in his hands.""The sentence forLee is the latest in a string of recent cases in which U.S. intelligenceworkers have been handed lengthy prison terms for espionage connected toChina. In announcing Lee's sentence, Judge T.S. Ellis III said that a heftysentence was necessary to deter others from jeopardizing U.S. intelligence.InMay, another CIA case officer, Kevin Patrick Mallory was sentenced to 20 yearsin prison for selling classified documents to a Chinese intelligence officerfor $25,000. Ellis, who presided over that case as well, decided that a lifesentence for Mallory was excessively harsh even though prosecutors showed hesuccessfully transmitted secret information.In September, Ron Rockwell Hansen,a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer, received 10 years in prison forattempting to pass along defense secrets.Lee's lawyers argued that the largelycircumstantial case against him was considerably weaker than others in whichdefendants were charged with espionage, and that speculating that theunexplained payments he received were compensation for information that harmedCIA operations was ""a bridge too far.""Although Lee pleaded guilty toconspiring with Chinese agents, lawyers on both sides conceded that there wasno direct evidence that Lee ever provided any of the classified information inhis possession to the Chinese government. The CIA has not shown that thesources listed in Lee's notes faced retribution or harm, Lee's lawyerssaid.""What the government is describing is their worst possible nightmare,""said Nina J. Ginsberg, one of Lee's lawyers.In announcing the sentence, Ellissaid he was not convinced that Lee's interactions with Chinese intelligenceofficers were benign, and that it is common in espionage cases to never fullyuncover the extent of illicit dealings.While he acknowledged that Lee, anaturalized citizen born in Hong Kong, had done a great deal with his life asan American -- four years in the Army, a 13-year career with the CIA -- Ellisappeared unmoved.""That gets erased,"" he said, ""when you betray yourcountry.""This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 TheNew York Times Company  "	['https://news.yahoo.com/ex-cia-officer-sentenced-19-152355446.html', 'http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vbvGcl7dJ3HJifPHAeZYdw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/7a966ce0-0e07-11ea-9f37-b1fe34cbffe5']
