Sign up here. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary HankPaulson said calls to oust Chinese companies from American stock indexes wascontrary to the foundations of capitalism, as he warned against the dangers ofdecoupling the world’s two largest economies.Paulson, who’s now chairman ofthe Paulson Institute, told Bloomberg’s New Economy Forum in Beijing thatmoves to reduce ties between the U.S. and China would weaken Americanleadership and New York’s leading role in finance. He said less cooperationbetween Washington and Beijing would also make it more difficult to tackleanother financial crisis like the one he was forced to manage as treasurysecretary in 2008.“When the next crisis comes -- and a crisis will come,because financial crises are inevitable -- we will regret it if we lackmechanisms for the world’s first and second-largest economies to coordinate,”Paulson told the forum on Thursday, according to a prepared version of hisremarks.Paulson’s speech followed on from his warning at the same forum lastyear that an “economic iron curtain” was descending between the U.S. andChinese economies. Since then, the relations between the two sides have growneven more strained by trade disputes, security spats and disagreement overhuman rights.The Trump administration has been pressuring allies to stop usingChinese technology. U.S. officials are also discussing ways to limit Americaninvestors’ portfolio flows into China, Bloomberg News reported in September,citing people familiar with the internal deliberations.The U.S. Treasury saidthat there was no plan “at this time” to block Chinese companies from listingon U.S. stock exchanges.“Decoupling China from U.S. markets by delistingChinese firms from US exchanges is a terrible idea,” Paulson said. “So isforcing Chinese equities out of the MSCI indexes. It is simply contrary to thefoundations of successful capitalism for politicians and bureaucrats toinstruct private American players how to deploy private capital for privateends.”The New Economy Forum is being organized by Bloomberg Media Group, adivision of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.\\--Withassistance from Karen Leigh.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:Peter Martin in Beijing at pmartin138@bloomberg.netTo contact the editorsresponsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, JamesMaygerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019Bloomberg L.P.

The fast gunboatsNikopol and Berdyansk and the tugboat Tany Kapu were welcomed by Ukrainianpresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy and onlookers waving national flags arrived inOchakiv, a Ukrainian naval port on the Black Sea on Wednesday evening. ButUkraine's navy said the vessels had been stripped bare and left so badlydamaged that they had to be towed home by tug. ""The Russians ruined them,""said Admiral Ihor Voronchenko, the head of the Ukrainian Navy. ""They even tookthe ceiling lights, plug sockets, and lavatories,"" he said. Mr Zelenskiy, whoreviewed the vessels as they returned on Thursday morning, said: ""I am veryhappy that our navy vessels are back where they belong. As promised, we havebrought back our sailors and our ships. ""Some of the equipment is missing, aswell as some weapons. There will be an investigation. We will see all of thedetails."" Russia blocked the Kerch strait with a tanker and deployed fighterjets to stop the three vessels entering the Azov Sea last year Credit: PavelRebrov/Reuters Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), which oversees theborder service that seized the vessels, denied tampering with the ships andsaid they had been ""handed over to the Ukrainian side in normal condition.""The three vessels were boarded by Russian forces after they tried to passthrough the Strait of Kerch in November last year. Russia says they illegallyviolated the Russian border, then impounded the vessels and jailed 24 crewmembers pending trial. Ukraine described the move as an act of war and aflagrant breach of the treaty that gives the countries joint sovereignty ofthe only channel between the Black and Azov seas. Mr Zelenskiy said the returnof the boats as the latest in a series of small steps ""towards peace"" ahead ofa key summit with Vladimir Putin next month.

In September the ships'crews were released in a prisoner swap that also saw Russia free Oleg Sentsov,a Ukrainian filmmaker and activist who had been held on trumped-up chargessince the annexation of Crimea in 2014. The sides have also agreed to pullback troops from key points on the line of contact in eastern Ukraine. Thenarrow sea way between Crimea and Russia's Taman peninsula is the only passagefor ships sailing to and from Ukraine's industrial port of Mariupol, to whichthe flotilla was bound when it was seized. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukrainein 2014 and opened a bridge across the strait in 2017 in defiance of Ukrainianobjections.

The 21-year-old Texas native was also sentenced to three years ofprobation and 1,000 hours of community service. The judge ordered Naquin towrite a letter of apology to the Gruver family, and for every year he is onprobation he must go to three separate high schools and give a one-hour talkabout hazing, according to WVLA-TV.He was expelled from LSU in the weeksfollowing Gruver’s death.Gruver died of alcohol poisoning andaspiration—choking on his own vomit—after a hazing ritual called “Bible Study”at the fraternity house on Sept. 13, 2017. During the ritual, prosecutors saidNaquin and other fraternity members ordered pledges to stand in a dark hallwayfacing a wall while loud music played; they were told to chug 190-proof liquorif they could not correctly answer questions about Phi Delta Theta, TheAdvocate reported.Witnesses reportedly testified during the trial that Naquin,whom authorities have said was a ringleader of the hazing ritual, targetedGruver that night because he didn’t want him to join the fraternity. Just twodays before Gruver’s death, fraternity brothers said they warned Naquin totone down his extreme and dangerous interactions with pledges, according tocourt documents and testimony during the trial.When he died, Gruver’s blood-alcohol level was 0.495 percent—more than six times the state’s legal limit todrive, according to the local newspaper. Another pledge had testified duringtrial that he believed Gruver “had not had much experience with drinking.” Atoxicology expert said on the stand that Gruver’s high blood-alcoholconcentration led to “sleep, coma and death.” “There was no way his body couldget through this,” said the expert, Patricia Williams. “He was a dead manwalking at midnight.”Naquin’s attorney, John McLindon, argued during the trialthat he was unfairly singled out by the prosecution and that Gruver continuedto drink on his own after the hazing event.“It was a hazing event, but therewere probably 10 other active members up there that night and at least five ofthem were handing out alcohol,” McLindon told The New York Times. “Matthewdidn’t do anything differently from those boys, but he got picked out becausehe is very loud.”But East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore IIIcountered, in a separate interview with The Times, that Naquin “stood out”through the ferocity with which he tormented pledges that night.“Everyone keptsaying he was the one who led everything, who made people drink more, whoasked questions,” Moore said. “This is grain alcohol—this is 180-proof or190-proof alcohol. It is what they put tissue samples in to study them in alab, when you have to wear a hood.”Moore added: “We have never alleged thatthe defendant wanted him dead or wanted to kill him, but his actions led tothis young man’s death.”Naquin has been separately charged with obstruction ofjustice after federal agents say he deleted nearly 700 files from his phoneminutes after he learned from his attorney that a search warrant had beenissued for his device. The FBI never successfully recovered the files. He hasnot been tried yet on that charge.After the trial, Max’s mother, Rae AnnGruver, called the guilty verdict “justice for our son and for the man whocaused his death.” Gruver was from Roswell, a suburb of Atlanta.“We want thisto send a message to the country that hazing should not exist,” StephenGruver, Max's father, told The Advocate after the conviction. “It’s dangerousand we have to all work together to bring an end to hazing.”Three otherfraternity brothers face misdemeanor hazing charges in the case, two of whichhave pleaded no contest. Phi Delta Theta has been banned from LSU’s campusuntil 2033. The school also reportedly convened a task force to study Greeklife on campus in the aftermath of Gruver’s death.“Hazing is an irresponsibleand dangerous activity that we do not tolerate at LSU,” a spokesman for theschool said after the trial. “These tragedies, and the penalties that follow,can be prevented, and we have been working diligently to put more safeguards,education and reporting outlets in place for our students regardinghazing.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Yeung, who has a Youtube channel oflargely pro-Beijing content was further instructed he would not be allowed toenter Singapore again without permission from the authorities.“Singapore hasalways been clear that foreigners should not advocate their political causesin Singapore, through public assemblies, and other prohibited means,” theSingapore Police Force told Channel News Asia late on Wednesday.Speaking fromSingapore’s Changi Airport on Thursday morning ahead of his flight, Yeung saidhe was now free to go where he pleased and thanked Singapore for upholding therule of law.Illegal Gatherings“The Singapore Police Force has made noindictment against me. I am warned to refrain from any criminal conduct in thefuture under their discretion,” he said in a video posted to YouTube.“Singapore is a very civilized country with very good security.”In 2017,Singapore revoked the permanent residency of prominent academic and Chinaexpert Huang Jing after he allegedly used his position to covertly advance theagenda of an unnamed foreign country at Singapore’s expense.Hong Kong has beengripped for days by the standoff at the city’s Polytechnic University, wherehard-core protesters remain surrounded by police. The unrest began in Junewith largely peaceful marches against legislation allowing extraditions tomainland China and have since mushroomed into a broader push for demandsincluding an independent probe into police violence and the ability tonominate and elect city leaders.Speaking to reporters on Monday, Singapore’sTrade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing warned a similar situation could“easily happen” in his country if the government is complacent. Underrestrictive laws, cause-related gatherings are illegal without a police permitand participants are subject to fines without it.\\--With assistance fromChester Yung.To contact the reporter on this story: Philip J.

Thu, 21 Nov 2019 13:20:24 -0500	Former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg Formally Files for 2020 Presidential Run	https://news.yahoo.com/former-nyc-mayor-michael-bloomberg-182024837.html	"Yana PaskovaFormer New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has taken the nextstep to join the scrum to unseat Donald Trump, formally filing to run as aDemocrat for the post of President of the United States.The billionaireDemocrat-turned-Republican-turned-Independent-turned-Democrat-again declaredhis candidacy with the Federal Election Commission early on Thursdayafternoon. Mike Bloomberg 2020 Inc., his campaign committee, also filed FECpaperwork.A Bloomberg spokesperson did not immediately respond to a requestfor comment on the filings. But no sooner had the filing been made public didword emerge that he had not yet made a final decision about hiscandidacy—merely filling out paperwork for it. Should he announce a runpublicly, Bloomberg will face a herculean task. He is likely to avoidcompeting in the early primary states—with hopes that his expansive war chestwill allow him to fair better in later contests. His potential entry will beinto an already crowded Democratic presidential primary field, one that hasalready attracted another late entrant on the party’s more moderate flank,former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick.Bloomberg has already taken steps toattempt to repair his image among segments of the Democratic electorate likelyto suspiciously eye an ultra-wealthy business executive with a technocraticrecord of promoting policies that are not necessarily popular with the public,including a harsh law enforcement policy that disproportionately affects NewYork’s African American community.At an appearance at a Brooklyn blackmegachurch over the weekend, Bloomberg apologized for policies such as “stop-and-frisk,” a highly controversial police tactic that gives police broadauthority to physically search anyone. NYPD abuse of the policy duringBloomberg’s tenure as mayor largely targeted black and Latinocommunities.“Over time, I’ve come to understand something that I longstruggled to admit to myself: I got something important wrong,” Bloomberg saidat Brooklyn’s Christian Cultural Center, reversing course on a position herepeatedly defended as mayor and after leaving office. “I didn’t understandback then the full impact that stops were having on the black and Latinocommunities. I was totally focused on saving lives—but as we know: goodintentions aren’t good enough.""Bloomberg is nevertheless likely to occupy anideological space closer to the center of the Democratic primary field. Thatwill likely pit him against former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend,Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg for similar blocs of primary voters, andposition him in opposition to the race’s more progressive standouts, Sens.Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.In spite ofpotentially problematic positions on issues such as urban policing, Bloombergdoes bring a long record of championing other issues dear to the Democraticfaithful. He is one of the country’s most outspoken supporters of new guncontrol policies, and has used his fortune to finance groups pushing for suchmeasures.Early polling shows that Bloomberg would face a steep climb to theupper echelons of the Democratic primary field. Despite his strong namerecognition, a recent survey by Reuters and Ipsos found him pulling just 3percent support nationally, the same level as California Sen. Kamala Harrisand well behind Biden, Buttigieg, Warren and Sanders.One area that likely willnot be a challenge for his candidacy is money. Bloomberg is worth an estimated$52 billion, and has not hesitated to pour money into political contests. Heis among the Democratic Party’s largest donors of the Trump era, and hasalmost single-handedly financed his own super PAC, Independence USA, to whichhe’s donated $112 million since 2012.Though nowhere near as wealthy asBloomberg, California hedge funder Tom Steyer, who entered the race for theDemocratic presidential nomination in July, has largely opted to self-fund hiscampaign. The immense amounts of his personal fortune that Steyer has dumpedinto his campaign have managed to land him on one debate stage, but haven’tpropelled him to viability in the Democratic field.Read more at The DailyBeast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

This allegeddiscussion recalled by Ambassador Sondland never happened.”In his testimony,Sondland recounted a meeting between Pence and Zelensky, in which Zelensky“raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice President Pence.”Sondland said that Pence told the Ukrainian president that he would askPresident Trump about it. In his statement, Short does not deny that the pairdiscussed military aid, but does say that “multiple witnesses have testifiedunder oath” that no investigations were ever brought up during the Septembermeeting between Pence and Zelensky.“Multiple witnesses have testified underoath that Vice President Pence never raised Hunter Biden, former VicePresident Joe Biden, Crowdstrike, Burisma, or investigations in anyconversation with Ukrainians or President Zelensky before, during, or afterthe September 1 meeting in Poland,” Short's statement concludes.Sondland alsotestified that he pulled top Ukrainian aide Andriy Yermak aside during theSeptember meeting to say that “he believed that the resumption of U.S. aidwould likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the publicstatement that we had been discussing for many weeks.” He added that herelayed this message at Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's behest.

Thu, 21 Nov 2019 11:09:25 -0500	Four Gas Export Projects Approved by U.S. Just as Outlook Dims	https://news.yahoo.com/four-gas-export-projects-approved-160925009.html	(Bloomberg) -- Four liquefied natural gas export projects were cleared by thetop U.S. energy regulator in a single day as a global supply glut casts doubton whether they all will actually be built.The Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission voted 2-1 in favor of three Texas LNG terminals-- ExelonCorp.-backed Annova LNG, NextDecade Corp.’s Rio Grande LNG and Texas LNG. Theyalso approved Cheniere Energy Inc.’s planned expansion at Corpus Christi inTexas. Democrat Commissioner Rich Glick, who has repeatedly criticized theagency for ignoring climate change, dissented. Combined, the projects wouldroughly double current U.S. LNG export capacity. The nation is already sendingmore gas overseas than ever as shale output surges. But prices have collapsedamid the U.S.-China trade war and a worldwide glut of the heating and power-plant fuel, making buyers increasingly unwilling to sign the long-termcontracts needed to develop multibillion-dollar terminals.“Resolution of thetrade war between the U.S. and China would go a long way, I think, to solvingthe market’s discomfort with long-term contracts,” Katie Bays, co-founder ofWashington-based Sandhill Strategy LLC, said by phone. “With Chinese growthcoming in lower than expected this year, however, committing to any terms in along-term contract probably feels like a big leap of faith.”The energycommission, which has approved about a half-dozen LNG export projects so farthis year, has faced repeated calls by developers to speed up reviews. To thatend, it has added staff and is opening up an office in Houston to cope withthe extra workload.The U.S. is the world’s fastest-growing LNG exporter as theshale boom catapults the country into the ranks of the top global suppliers ofthe fuel, behind Qatar and Australia. The latest projects to be approved wouldbe ideally situated to draw gas from the Permian Basin, where supplies havesoared as a byproduct of oil output. But most of the increase in American LNGcargoes over the next few years will likely come from projects that havealready reached a final investment decision.To contact the reporter on thisstory: Stephen Cunningham in Washington at scunningha10@bloomberg.netTocontact the editors responsible for this story: David Marino atdmarino4@bloomberg.net, Christine Buurma, Reg GaleFor more articles like this,please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.
